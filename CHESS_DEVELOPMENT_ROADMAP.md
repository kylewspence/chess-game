## Key Implementation Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management**: Using custom `useChessGame` hook for game state management
2. **Performance**: Chess UI is responsive with proper state updates
3. **Move Validation**: Robust move validation system prevents illegal states
4. **Coordinate System**: Uses 0-indexed arrays with algebraic notation conversion

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

- âœ… Implemented move validation before piece movement
- âœ… Handled all edge cases (en passant, castling conditions)
- âœ… Implemented check/checkmate detection correctly
- âœ… Used standard chess notation for move representation

### Development Approach Used

- âœ… Built incrementally, testing each phase thoroughly
- âœ… Started with simple board and pieces before adding interactions
- âœ… Tested each piece type thoroughly before moving to the next
- âœ… Implemented special moves after basic movement worked
- âœ… Used chess notation standards for move representation

## Success Criteria âœ… ACHIEVED

- [x] Full chess game playable by two human players
- [x] All FIDE rules implemented correctly
- [x] Intuitive and responsive user interface
- [x] No illegal moves possible
- [x] Proper game end detection
- [x] Move history and basic analysis features

**Total Development Time**: ~6 weeks for complete implementation including all core features and advanced UI components.

**Current Status**: Production-ready chess game with professional features!
