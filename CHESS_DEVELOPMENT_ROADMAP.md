  - [ ] Castling legality checks (no prior moves, clear path, not in check)
- [ ] **En Passant**: Pawn capture special case
  - [ ] Track double pawn moves
  - [ ] Implement en passant capture
- [ ] **Pawn Promotion**: Promote pawns reaching end ranks
  - [ ] Show promotion dialog
  - [ ] Handle piece selection for promotion

### 5.3 Game State Management

### 10.3 Analysis Tools

- [ ] Move annotations
- [ ] Position analysis
- [ ] Opening recognition
- [ ] Endgame tablebase integration

## Key Implementation Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management**: Consider using Zustand for game state due to chess's complex state requirements
2. **Performance**: Chess UI needs to be responsive - use React.memo and useMemo strategically
3. **Move Validation**: Implement a robust move validation system early to prevent illegal states
4. **Coordinate System**: Choose between 0-indexed arrays vs. chess algebraic notation early

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't implement piece movement before move validation
- Don't forget to handle edge cases (en passant, castling conditions)
- Don't skip the check/checkmate detection - it's core to chess
- Don't implement complex features before basic gameplay works

### Development Tips

- Start with a simple board and pieces before adding interactions
- Test each piece type thoroughly before moving to the next
- Implement special moves (castling, en passant) after basic movement works
- Use chess notation standards for move representation
- Consider using a chess library (like chess.js) for move validation if building from scratch becomes too complex

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Full chess game playable by two human players
- [ ] All FIDE rules implemented correctly
- [ ] Intuitive and responsive user interface
- [ ] No illegal moves possible
- [ ] Proper game end detection
- [ ] Move history and basic analysis features

**Estimated Development Time**: 3-6 weeks for core functionality, additional 2-4 weeks for polish and advanced features.

**Recommended Approach**: Build incrementally, testing each phase thoroughly before proceeding to the next. Focus on getting basic gameplay working before adding advanced features.
